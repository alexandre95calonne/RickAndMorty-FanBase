# âœ¨ Rick & Morty FanBase Presentation âœ¨

I've developed a React-based project that utilizes the Rick and Morty API (https://rickandmortyapi.com/). The application showcases various episodes with pagination, offers filtering options by season, and displays characters for each episode. Users can also mark episodes as their favorites. Additionally, the project includes a statistics page, a random character display page, and a dedicated page presenting the user's favorite episodes.

## You can see the project at : https://alexandre95calonne.github.io/RickAndMorty-FanBase/
